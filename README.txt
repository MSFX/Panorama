Panorama is a library for creating interactive 3d panoramas within AS3 using Flash Player 10 and Away3d 3.6.  A version for Flash Player 11 with Away3d 4.0 will be released in the coming months.

Panorama supports both static (BitmapMaterial) and animated (MovieMaterial) textures for the panorama as well as interaction with the texture, i.e. hotspots.

Panorama also features several restrictional values allowing you to limit the rotation around both the X and Y axis or disable rotation around each of the axis completely.

Panorama comes with built in click and glide functionality as well as mouse wheel zoom functionality.

- addClickAndGlide() / removeClickAndGlide()
